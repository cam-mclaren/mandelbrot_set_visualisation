Notes on video size. 

I may want to upload videos of different sizes to youtube and instagram. 

According to the following website:


https://invideo.io/blog/instagram-video-size/#:~:text=The%20Instagram%20feed%20supports%20videos,1080%20pixels%20x%201350%20pixels.

The best resolution for instagram videos is 1080x1350. This is a portrait video that favours user experinence on 
the phone app. 


I will need to investigate, probably opencv is the best option for me. Paul the Solarian Programmer has a few tutorials 
on opencv which I think could be really usefull for me.
